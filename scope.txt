Class names can be declared before they are defined, requiring multiple passes.
C++ has no classes because it is single pass.

lesson from lecture, "It is much better if it makes your life easier to have
multiple simple passes rather than have one big complicated pass where all
the code is entangled. It is much easier to debug your compiler if you are
willing to make multiple passes over the language.
